# LinearRegression

Q1) One feature regression for Boston data.
Choose one of the features in Boston data, try to select one that is mostly correlated (or inversely correlated) with the target. Fit a line with linear regression (you can use built-in LinearRegression() method). What is the equation of the fitting line? Please plot your data points (chosen feature vs. target) and plot your fitting line on it.
